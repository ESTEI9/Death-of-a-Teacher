                                    Follow raw neophyte teacher Dale Barrow on his reflective romp into the purgatory of the burlesque - southern Decadia Heights High School - as he finds himself caught in an ever-weaving orb that changes his life and those around him forever.<br/><br/>

                                    In fits and turns, Barrow strives to decipher eccentric characters, deformed policies, broken, and requited love, and the profundity of loss in many forms. Desperate for grounding, he remains tethered to his outside world of a childhood friendship, his demented mother, and a doting Aunt.

                                <p>
                                    It’s the nineteen-eighties, on the cusp of rapid societal changes, and Barrow experiments with a strange "intercommunication" technology, initiates literacy mentoring, pushes a neuvo "green" movement to his charges, befriends and enables handicapped colleagues, and uses the modalities of music and dancing to reach his students - yet finds himself at censure’s door. To complicate matters, he drifts into a platonic relationship with a beautiful senior student, Angelea, who must talk him out of leaving the profession at his nadir.<br/><br/>

                                    As romantic currents with Angelea fester and the year nears closure, he becomes the victim of a gang attack and, with the help of a disabled associate, prevents a murder attempt on an unpopular teacher. These swirling eddies and other happenstance induce his departure from the Heights and his move north to live with his sister. Yet somehow he has worked fate - or it has worked him - and he re-connects with Angelea. They court properly, re-invent their relationship, and wed by story’s end.<br/><br/>

                                    Combine <i>Gatsby</i> (Fitzgerald) and <i>Invisible Man</i> (Ellison), mix in some Orwellian spice, and emerge with <i>Death of a Teacher</i>.<br/><br/>

                                    Not just a young teacher’s escapades in the public school system, Death probes the deeper strata of his lark of discovery. McShain's account of Dale Barrow's journey to perdition and back higher than he ever dreamed will create in the reader’s soul an afterlife all its own.

                                    ...The devil got his dirty hand in things, when the Lord made kids. The devil went to the Lord and asked could he use certain ones of them, please, to test teachers, and make their lives miserable and the Lord said ‘Yes’. And the kids said can we use our parents to help make the teachers’ lives miserable and the Lord said yes again. And the devil took those kids and their parents and scattered them out to all schools, teachers, and yes, us administrators too…And the devil saw that it was all mischief, he says, and there was evening and there was morning – the fifth day.

                                    Arthur McShain is from Michigan and resides and teaches high school science in Greenville, South Carolina. He has an M.Ed in science education from Ga. State University.
                                    <i>Death of a Teacher</i> has one autobiographical sentence - found in the beginning of the second paragraph: 
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>I’m dead now, but it’s not what everyone thinks, or what it’s cracked up to be.</blockquote>

                                        Though the idea and basic material for the novel were engendered some twenty-five years ago, the major work was begun when the author was, in fact, on his deathbed (in 2014), struggling with an illness that threatened to take his life. During this health crucible, author McShain literally wrote his last words (18 pages long of positive reflections), and decided to try and write a novel, which would be his last “letter” left on earth. Thus the opening line of the second paragraph of the novel - figuring that if he did die, the novel would have one line of pure, autobiographical truth. He slowly rebounded from the illness (gratefully), returned to full health over a two-year period, continued refining and revising the novel, and now presents the finished work.

                                        In the past he wrote satire for several different newspapers, among them "The Gwinnett News" in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He has written five screenplays:

                                        The last screenplay, <i>Dreamers of the Day</i>, is a biopic on Walt Disney. It was submitted to the services, mentorship and marketing efforts of a NY Producer, Lee Levinson, in an attempt to approach Disney Pictures to produce the movie. It also won "screenplay of the month" on a major screenwriting website.
